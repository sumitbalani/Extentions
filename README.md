Messing around with Chrome Extentions

Overview: 

Google Chrome is the best web browser around right now, and part of Chrome's appeal is owed to its excellent extensions. 
I wanted to learn the simple chrome extensions, include the file structure and manifest.json file notation before 
I spent time developing a much more extensive extension. 

Basics:

A manifest.json file along with an .html and/or .js file.

Every Chrome extension consists of, at minimum, a file called manifest.json, which defines the basics of your 
extension—its name, description, version number, what kind of extension it is (there are a handful of different 
things a Chrome extension can do), the permissions it needs to run 
(e.g., what web sites it needs access to), and so on.
